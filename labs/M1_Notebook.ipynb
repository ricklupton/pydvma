    "In this experiment you will measure natural frequencies of vibrating beams after impulsive loading.  Carefully supported beams will be struck, and the resulting vibrations measured using a microphone and data-logger. The frequency of free vibration of beams depends on the density (the inertia) and the stiffness: low density and high stiffness mean higher frequencies. The stiffness of beams in turn depends on the geometry (the length and cross-sectional shape) and the material (the Youngâ€™s modulus). The decay rate of the vibrations also provides information on damping i.e. energy loss during vibration. Two materials will be considered: aluminium alloy and the polymer PMMA."
